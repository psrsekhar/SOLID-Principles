# SOLID Principles Concepts

A comprehensive guide to understanding and applying the **SOLID principles** of object-oriented programming (OOP).  
These principles form the foundation of **clean, maintainable, and scalable** software design.

---

## 📘 Overview

The **SOLID** principles are a set of five design principles that help developers write code that is easier to manage, extend, and test.  
This repository provides clear **concept explanations**, **bad vs. good code examples**, and **practical scenarios** demonstrating each principle.

## 🧩 The SOLID Principles

### 1. **S — Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)**
> A class should have only one reason to change.

- Focuses on keeping classes small and focused.  
- Each class should handle only one responsibility.  

### 2. **O — Open/Closed Principle (OCP)**
> Software entities should be open for extension, but closed for modification.

- Allows behavior to be extended without modifying existing code.  
- Encourages use of abstractions, interfaces, and inheritance carefully.

### 3. **L — Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP)**
> Subtypes must be substitutable for their base types.

- Derived classes should not break the functionality of base classes.  
- Promotes reliable polymorphism.

### 4. **I — Interface Segregation Principle (ISP)**
> Clients should not be forced to depend on interfaces they do not use.

- Encourages splitting large interfaces into smaller, specific ones.  
- Helps avoid unnecessary dependencies.

### 5. **D — Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP)**
> Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.

- High-level modules should not depend on low-level modules.  
- Both should depend on abstractions (e.g., interfaces).
